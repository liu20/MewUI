.SYNOPSIS
    Pushes a prepared release and tags it.

.DESCRIPTION
    Re-checks what Prepare-Release.ps1 produced, then pushes main before creating and pushing the tag.
    The order matters: pushing a tag carries its objects but leaves origin/main behind, which is how a
    release ends up ahead of the branch it claims to come from.

.PARAMETER Version
    Version to publish, without the leading v. Must match the version already in the repository.

.EXAMPLE
    ./tools/release/Publish-Release.ps1 -Version 0.20.0
#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
    [string] $Version
)

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
. (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'ReleaseCommon.ps1')

$tag = "v$Version"
