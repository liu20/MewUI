# NativeAOT size tools

MewUI treats pay-for-play NativeAOT output as a framework contract. Adding a feature must not silently make unrelated applications carry its implementation, constructed generic types, or metadata.

## Canonical probes

| Probe | Content | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Empty | `Window` only | Minimum platform, backend, application, and window graph |
| Text | One `TextBlock` | Text layout and rendering increment |
| Button | One empty `Button` | Control, style, input, and command increment without text content |
| Image | One raw-pixel `Image` | Image control and raster-source increment without encoded-image I/O |

The primary regression lane is Windows x64 with GDI. All probes use .NET 10, self-contained NativeAOT, full trimming, size optimization, invariant globalization, no debug symbols, and an ILC map. Do not compare results produced by different SDKs, runtime identifiers, backends, or publish properties.

## Architectural rules

1. `Application`, `Window`, graphics backends, and disposal paths must not directly construct optional features.
2. Registries must not eagerly enumerate every optional control or implementation.
3. Default and named styles must preserve per-control reachability.
4. Public interface and virtual members must be audited in the NativeAOT map.
5. A service abstraction is pay-for-play only when its concrete creation path is removable.
6. Size changes require executable A/B measurements and map evidence.

Each styled control owns its default-style registration in its own source declaration. Keep style factories `internal`, add an explicit static constructor when needed, and never rebuild a central factory table.

## Baselines

The committed JSON is a regression baseline, not a value to refresh after unexplained growth. A baseline change requires old and new reports, changed-probe map comparison, a concrete explanation, and explicit review of any raised budget.

The current SDK 10.0.301 Windows x64/GDI probes measure Empty at 3,022,336 bytes, Text at 3,412,480 bytes, Button at 3,479,040 bytes, and Image at 3,433,472 bytes. The Empty map retains no tracing types, LibJpeg, built-in encoded-image decoder, file-dialog style, optional default-style, or panel implementation methods.

## Commands

Run the four canonical probes on Windows GDI:

```powershell
./tools/aot-size/Measure-AotSize.ps1
```

Check growth against the committed observation baseline:

```powershell
./tools/aot-size/Measure-AotSize.ps1 `
  -BaselinePath ./tools/aot-size/baselines/win-x64-gdi.json
```

Compare two NativeAOT maps:

```powershell
./tools/aot-size/Compare-AotMaps.ps1 `
  -BaselineMap path/to/baseline.map.xml `
  -CurrentMap path/to/current.map.xml
```

Generated executables, maps, and reports are written below `.artifacts/aot-size/`.

When release-size documentation needs refreshing, run the manual cross-platform measurement from Windows:

```powershell
./tools/aot-size/Update-ReleaseSizes.ps1 `
  -MacHost your-mac-host `
  -MacPort 22 `
  -MacUser your-user
```

The command measures Windows locally, Linux through WSL using the same `/mnt` checkout, and macOS through SSH using the synchronized `~/Dev/MewUI` checkout. It requires matching source manifests, writes byte-accurate values to `release-sizes.json`, and regenerates both SVG files. The MewUI version is read from `build/MewUI.Common.props` and displayed in each SVG.

This command is not part of CI or the release workflow. Run it explicitly only when the committed size assets need a new measurement.

Use `-SkipLinux`, `-SkipMacOS`, or `-SkipWindows` only for an intentionally partial refresh. The platform-specific .NET SDK version is neither compared nor recorded because NativeAOT SDK and runtime packs differ by operating system.

To rebuild only the JSON and SVG assets from existing reports under `.artifacts/release-size/reports`, run `Update-ReleaseSizes.ps1 -StartAt 3`. The selected platform reports must exist and share the current MewUI version and source manifest; combine it with a skip switch for an intentionally partial update.
